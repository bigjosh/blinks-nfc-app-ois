# blinks-nfc-app-ois
The ugliest iOS code to talk to NFC blinks

The structure is horrible, but successfully sends a game image that is hard coded into the app right now. 
Hopefully enough comments to figure out what is going on and how to put it into a good form. 

Meat is in blinks-nfc-app-ois/buttonNFC2/ViewController.swift
